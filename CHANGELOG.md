    displayed in Azure DevOps for each test run.
  - Set a display name on all the jobs and tasks in the CI pipeline.
  - The deploy step is now only run when merged to branch `master` in the
    DSC Community upstream repository (not to branch `master` in a fork
    which always failed due to missing credentials).

    files inside the `source` folder.

### Fixed

- xFailOverCluster
  - The component `gitversion` that is used in the pipeline was wrongly configured
    when the repository moved to the new default branch `main`. It no longer throws
    an error when using newer versions of GitVersion.
  - Added CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file, and a 'Code of Conduct' section in the
    README.md.
  - Improved CI pipeline
    - Renamed the jobs
    - Splitting up the testing in different jobs.
  - URLs in the module manifest pointed in the wrong direction.
  - Changed the encoding that will be used by ModuleBuilder (`UTF-8`).

    structure.
  - Release pipeline stopped working in some circumstances, workaround is
    to pin ModuleBuilder to version `1.0.0` for now.
    *There is an issue with ModuleBuilder with preview strings using dash,*
    *e.g. `fix0008-9`. The string is compliant with SemVer 2.0 but there*
    *is a bug in `Publish-Module` that prevents the module to be released.*

    branch master in forks.
